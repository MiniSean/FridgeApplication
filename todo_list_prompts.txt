Todo:

New workspace toolbar modes:
- Handgrab (canvas move)
- Select (box selection)

New default nodes:
- Node with angled (optimal routing) links
: Prompt 1 :
Write a class that extends the DefaultNodeModel from projectstorm react-diagrams library that:
- Has two output ports 'Output-I' and 'Output-Q'.
- Both ports should use the default RightAnglePortModel, which is an extension of the DefaultPortModel (also from react-diagrams), this model creates a RightAngleLinkModel when calling its createLinkModel method.
- Ensure that all ports have their canLinkPort property set to true and the maximumLink property set to 1.
- Make sure the CustomNodeModel and RightAnglePortModel classes have the export key.
- Create the corresponding CustomNodeFactory and RightAngleLinkFactory and give a comment in the code on where to use these.
- Create the corresponding CustomNodeWidget and RightAngleLinkWidget and give a comment in the code on where to use these.

- Node with icon in top left
- Node with description or visualization (plot) in center.
- Node with constant (enum) dropdown at position of input ports.
- Node with gradient.
- Ports with description or Icon.
: Prompt 1 :
Write a class that extends the DefaultNodeWidget from projectstorm react-diagrams library with the following requirements:
- Name this class CustomNodeWidget.
Update the render method such that:
- The node 'header' (where normally the name is visualized) now has the option for the left square section of the header to get a specified color (for example orange) and a specific icon (for example MUI settings icon).
- Make sure that functions like 'renderPortLabels', 'getInPorts' and 'getOutPorts' are implemented in the same way that react-diagram implements them by default.

New node selection feature:
- When selecting node open a small tooltip above node with 'delete'
